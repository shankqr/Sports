/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SPJuggler takes objects that implement SPAnimatable (e.g. `SPTween`s) and executes them.
 
 A juggler is a simple object. It does no more than saving a list of objects implementing 
 `SPAnimatable` and advancing their time if it is told to do so (by calling its own `advanceTime:`
 method). Furthermore, an object can request to be removed from the juggler by dispatching an
 `SPEventTypeRemoveFromJuggler` event.
 
 There is a default juggler that you can access from anywhere with the following code:
 
	SPJuggler *juggler = Sparrow.juggler;
 
 You can, however, create juggler objects yourself, too. That way, you can group your game 
 into logical components that handle their animations independently.
 
 A cool feature of the juggler is to delay method calls. Say you want to remove an object from its
 parent 2 seconds from now. Call:

	[[juggler delayInvocationAtTarget:object byTime:2.0] removeFromParent];
 
 This line of code will execute the following method 2 seconds in the future:

 	[object removeFromParent];
 
 Alternatively, you can use the block-based verson of the method:

	[juggler delayInvocationByTime:2.0 block:^{ [object removeFromParent]; };
