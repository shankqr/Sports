/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Optimizes rendering of a number of quads with an identical state.
 
 The majority of all rendered objects in Sparrow are quads. In fact, all the default
 leaf nodes of Sparrow are quads (the `SPImage` and `SPQuad` classes). The rendering of those
 quads can be accelerated by a big factor if all quads with an identical state are sent
 to the GPU in just one call. That's what the `SPQuadBatch` class can do.
 
 The `flatten` method of the `SPSprite` class uses this class internally to optimize its
 rendering performance. In most situations, it is recommended to stick with flattened
 sprites, because they are easier to use. Sometimes, however, it makes sense
 to use the SPQuadBatch class directly: e.g. you can add one quad multiple times to
 a quad batch, whereas you can only add it once to a sprite. Furthermore, this class
 does not dispatch `ADDED` or `ADDED_TO_STAGE` events when a quad
 is added, which makes it more lightweight.
 
 One QuadBatch object is bound to a specific render state. The first object you add to a
 batch will decide on the QuadBatch's state, that is: its texture, its settings for
 smoothing and repetition, and if it's tinted (colored vertices and/or transparency).
 When you reset the batch, it will accept a new state on the next added quad.
