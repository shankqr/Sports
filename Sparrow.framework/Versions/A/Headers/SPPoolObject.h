/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SPPoolObject class is an alternative to the base class `NSObject` that manages a pool of
 objects.

 Subclasses of SPPoolObject do not deallocate object instances when the retain counter reaches
 zero. Instead, the objects stay in memory and will be re-used when a new instance of the object
 is requested. That way, object initialization is accelerated. You can release the memory of all
 recycled objects anytime by calling the `purgePool` method.

 Sparrow uses this class for `SPPoint`, `SPRectangle` and `SPMatrix`, as they are created very often
 as helper objects.

 To use memory pooling for another class, you just have to inherit from SPPoolObject.
