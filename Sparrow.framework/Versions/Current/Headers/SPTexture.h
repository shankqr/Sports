/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A texture stores the information that represents an image. It cannot be displayed directly, 
 but has to be mapped onto a display object. In Sparrow, that display object is `SPImage`.
 
 **Image formats**
 
 Sparrow supports different file formats for textures. The most common formats are `PNG`, which
 contains an alpha channel, and `JPG` (without an alpha channel). You can also load files in 
 the `PVR` format (compressed or uncompressed). That's a special format of the graphics chip of
 iOS devices that is very efficient.
 
 **HD textures**
 
 Furthermore, Sparrow supports development in multiple resolutions, i.e. creating a game
 simultaneously for normal and retina displays. If HD texture support is activated (it is by default
 if you start Sparrow with `[SPViewController startWithRoot:]`) and you load a texture like this:
 
    [[SPTexture alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:@"image.png"];
  
 Sparrow will check if it finds the file `image@2x.png`, and will load that instead (provided that
 it is available and the application is running on a HD device). The texture object will then
 return values for width and height that are the original number of pixels divided by 2 
 (by setting their scale-factor to `2.0`). That way, you will always work with the same values 
 for width and height - regardless of the device type.
 
 It is also possible to switch textures depending on the device the app is executed on. The 
 convention is to add a device modifier (`~ipad` or `~iphone`) to the image name, directly before 
 the file extension (and after the scale modifier, if there is one).
 
 **Drawing API**
 
 Sparrow lets you create custom graphics directly at run-time by using the `Core Graphics` API.
 You access the drawing API with a special init-method of SPTexture, which takes a `block`-parameter
 you can fill with your drawing code. 
  
	SPTexture *customTexture = [[SPTexture alloc] initWithWidth:200 height:100
	    draw:^(CGContextRef context)
	    {
	        // draw a string
	        CGContextSetGrayFillColor(context, 1.0f, 1.0f);
	        NSString *string = @"Hello Core Graphics";
	        [string drawAtPoint:CGPointMake(20.0f, 20.0f) 
                       withFont:[UIFont fontWithName:@"Arial" size:25]];
	    }];

 **Texture Frame**
 
 The frame property of a texture allows you to define the position where the texture will appear 
 within an `SPImage`. The rectangle is specified in the coordinate system of the texture:
 
    SPTexture *baseTexture = [SPTexture textureWithContentsOfFile:@"10x10.png"];
	SPRectangle *frame = [SPRectangle rectangleWithX:-10 y:-10 width:30 height:30];
    SPTexture *texture = [SPTexture textureWithRegion:nil frame:frame ofTexture:baseTexture];
	SPImage *image = [SPImage imageWithTexture:texture];
 
 This code would create an image with a size of 30x30, with the texture placed at x=10, y=10 within 
 that image (assuming that the base texture has a width and height of 10 pixels, it would appear in
 the middle of the image). This is especially useful when a texture has transparent areas at its
 sides. It is then possible to crop the texture (removing the transparent edges) and make up for that 
 by specifying a frame. 
 
 The texture class itself does not make any use of the frame data. It's up to classes that use
 `SPTexture` to support that feature.
