    <p class="p1">Congratulations on signing the contract with our ice hockey club. 
      As the new manager, you will get the opportunity to reach the stars with 
      this team. For starters you have 6 players and our small arena at your disposal. 
      You can acquire new players and start building up the arena and the facilities.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">This is a game where you get to lead a virtual ice hockey team 
      to glory, in competition with other participants from all over the world. 
      It is a simple game and it's easy to grasp the basics. You can play it even 
      if you just log in once or twice a week. The challenge is not to beat the 
      game, the challenge lies within the competition with the other participants. 
      While competing, many participants become friends, making this game also 
      a social game.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">You perform the duties of both manager and club owner. You plan 
      your tactics, decide what to train and select which players to play. You 
      buy and sell players, invest in arena improvements and much more. To be 
      successful, a good piece of advice is to form a good strategy and a long-term 
      plan. Success and glory will not come easily, after all.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">When you take charge of your team it has just been placed as 
      an expansion team in one of the two lowest divisions in the series system. 
      To start your climb upwards you have a squad of players, some might be talented 
      and some might not, a small arena and some money to your aid. Now it's time 
      for you to show your magic. Don't worry about second thoughts when it comes 
      to your club name. You can always change your club name anytime for only 
      $10,000.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Good luck!</p>
    <p class="p1"></p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">Managing a ice hockey team is not only about training and tactics, 
      it's about psychology as well. Your team has to want to win and they have 
      to believe in themselves. Your team psychology affects your match results, 
      and in return your match results also affect your team psychology.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1"><b>Team spirit</b></p>
    <p class="p1">How much your squad enjoys the atmosphere in the club is of 
      great influence. The team spirit affects your playmakers' performance on 
      the ice, and as a result of that how much puck possession they will get. 
      The higher team spirit you have, the better your center will perform - which 
      is reflected in the center sector rating. Team spirit itself can be affected 
      by a lot of things, but in particular your coach's leadership, the team 
      attitude you set for each match, transfers and psychologists.</p>
    <p class="p1"><b> </b></p>
    <p class="p1"><b>Confidence</b></p>
    <p class="p1">Your players have to believe in themselves to perform well, 
      and a team with low confidence will have trouble putting their opportunities 
      away. High confidence is normally a good thing, but if it gets too high, 
      players may underestimate weaker teams. Team confidence is reflected in 
      the attack sector ratings. Confidence is largely dependent on the results 
      of previous games, but psychologists are also known to boost it.</p>

<h2 id="4"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-122" title="Help-bigicon-the-game" src="button_transfer.png" alt="" height="40" width="40"> 4. Transfers</h2>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">The Transfers list all the players that are available to be 
      transferred to new teams. To acquire one of the players on the list, you 
      will need to place a bid on the player. When the first bid is place on a 
      player a 24 hour count down clock will start to count down until the bidding 
      for that player will end. When the bidding time is finished, the player 
      will be acquired by the team who had the highest bid at the time. </p>
	<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">When placing a bid on a player that already has a bid, you will 
      need to bid at least 10 thousand higher than the highest bid for the player.</p>
	  <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">One thing to keep in mind when biding is the age of the player, 
      because remember every player will retire when they reach age 35, so if 
      you win a bid for a player that is 28 years old, then he will only be able 
      to complete 7 seasons for your team before retiring. (Note: all players 
      will age one year at the end of each League season). Along these same lines, 
      if you are really concerned about getting the most games possible from that 
      5 star player, it is better to acquire them at the beginning of a league 
      season rather than at the end. It doesn't matter how many games a player 
      plays in a season, at the end of the season, they will get one year older.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">When finding your club's next stars, you may also want to notice 
      that not only do the players have different skill levels, and transfer value 
      (which is the start point for bidding), but they also have varying weekly 
      salaries that you will have to pay them each week.</p>
	  <p class="p1"> </p>
	  
    <p class="p1">Your team can increase the number of transfer players that you 
      will have available to your team by hiring more Scouts on to your staff. 
    </p>
	   <p class="p1"> </p>	  
    <p class="p1">Also in the Transfers area you can access the coaches that are 
      available for hire. Coaches unlike players are just acquired if your club 
      is willing to pay their listed value, and you do not need to go through 
      any bidding process. </p>

    <p class="p1">Based on the player's skills, try to assign your players to positions 
      where they will play their best and help the team. In addition, keep an 
      eye on your players Fitness level as this will also effect the player performance 
      in games. </p>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">In each half a number of attacks are made, and the center decides 
      which team gets each attack. The team with the strongest centers is most 
      likely to get the largest number of attacks. When a team gets an attack 
      it is decided what kind of attack it is. There are three types of attacks: 
      right wing, left wing, or center. The attacking team's attack for that sector 
      will then try to break through the defending team's defense for that sector.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">In each match a number of basic attacks are made. Some of these attacks are open, and can be taken by either team, and some are exclusive for one team only.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">For open attacks, the center decides which team gets each attack. 
      Exclusive attacks work in the same fashion, with one exception: If your 
      center “win” one of your opponent’s exclusive attacks; you stop the 
      attack – but you don’t get it yourself. You can’t get your opponent’s 
      exclusive chances, and they can’t get yours.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Most of the basic attacks are reported in the match report. You 
      may also gain additional attacks from &quot;Special Events&quot; and from 
      counter-attacks.</p>
<p class="p1"><b> </b></p>
    <p class="p1">The home team is helped by their fans. Ordinarily you have a 
      larger percentage of possession at home than away. In a &quot;cross-town 
      rivalry&quot; (when both teams are from the same region) the home team still 
      receives the advantage, but the away team receives about half the advantage. 
      If the game is played on neutral ground, neither team receives any advantage.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">Team spirit, confidence and team attitude affect how well your team performs.</p>

    <p class="p1">To give all your players training in their right positions, 
      friendly games are always a good option. Often it is used to let the reserves 
      play and train, but it can also be a good way to test and train new formations 
      and orders. Or why not challenge your best friend for a matter of honor. 
      By challenging a club you also put money where your mouth is, in all challenges 
      you can set the stake that ranges from $5,000 to $200,000.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">The easiest way to get a friendly is to simply tap on a club 
      in the match, league, map, chat or search page. You can also tap on Bluetooth 
      for a direct one to one connection with another club manager. A menu will 
      pop up from below and select view club info, and then tap on the map icon 
      below. You can now see a red challenge button below the map location of 
      that club, tap that button and a challenge dialog box will appear. Now you 
      can enter a message to send to the other club you want to challenge. Try 
      to write something provoking or funny so that they accept your challenge. 
      On the terms below you can set the amount of money they will receive from 
      you (green) if they win, or if they lose, how much they have to pay you 
      (red).</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Ticket sales from friendly match are used to boost up fan support 
      and donated to fan clubs. All of your challenges, including teams who have 
      challenged you, are shown on the match page. Once a friendly has been played, 
      it will appear on the played match segment of the match page.</p>
     <p class="p1"> </p>

    <p class="p1">A league season is 5 weeks long with 18 league rounds. In the 
      18 league rounds, the 10 teams in each series play each other twice; once 
      at Home and once Away.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">The league basic structure is organized into division and series. The highest division is Division 1 and it has only 1 Series. Division 2 has 5 Series, Division 3 has 25 Series, and Division 4 has 125 Series. Division 5 and above has 625 Series.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">One of the main objectives of this game is to get your club promoted to the highest Division possible. If you are top 5 in your series you will advance directly to a higher division, but if you are bottom 5 you will be demoted to a lower division. The final standings are determined by, in order of importance, points, goal difference and goals scored. This in turn determines your ranking in the series. If all of these things are equal a coin toss decides.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">If you are promoted to a higher division you get a promotion bonus of $100,000. If you finish first, second or third place you will get some prize money on top of the promotion bonus you already receive.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">Promotion will also boost up your number of fans by 5%, similarly if you are demoted you will lose 5% of your fans.</p>

<p class="p1">It's a lot of prestige to win the cup, and for your fans the cup is just as important as the league. The cup is also a good opportunity to make some extra money. The big money is in the crowd revenue so just advancing a few rounds can be a real bargain if you play in a lower division.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">The cup is always played midweek. Your opponent is announced 
      one week in advance, for the next round your opponent is announced shortly 
      after all matches for the current cup round has ended. All cup games not 
      settled during normal time go to extra time, where they may be decided by 
      a sudden death, first goal wins. If they are not decided then, they go to 
      a penalty shoot-out.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">In general, fans aren't very interested in the first couple of rounds of the cup, but their interest will increase as it goes on. It's also true that the fans of a lower division team will want to see a game against a higher division side, but that is not true the other way around.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">The best teams in the cup also get some prize money.</p>

    <p class="p1">As the manager for your club you decide how your team will play 
      and which formation to use. Before each game you must set your decision, 
      at least 5 minutes before the opening face off. For each game you select 
      your starting six players and your substitutes. In the order form you choose 
      which player goes where by taping on the position on the rink and selecting 
      a player from the list.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">If one of your players gets injured, the substitute for that 
      position will enter the rink. If you don't have a substitute assigned to 
      a certain position, or if the substitute is injured as well, one of the 
      other substitutes will automatically get selected to play. If you don't 
      have any able substitutes you'll have to continue the game with 5 players. 
      If you're out of subs and your goalkeeper gets injured, another player will 
      move to that spot. Remember that you must start your game with at least 
      6 players to avoid a walkover, which also means the effect of training for 
      the whole week will be lost.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">You can try playing with different formation to see how your 
      team plays best. </p>

      10. Arena</h2>
    <p class="p1">Your club will start off with a small arena, which you will have 
      the opportunity to improve throughout your management career. On the arena 
      page you can see and manage all details about your arena, and surrounding 
      business opportunities.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">In the match reports you're able to see how many seats were 
      sold. The income from a game is divided in the following manner; the home 
      team takes two-thirds of the income and away team gets one-third.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">How many spectators visit your arena largely depends on your 
      fan base total combined with your opponent's fans total amount.</p>

    <p class="p1">Training is the area where you can use Energy to do training 
      drills that will increase your Club's XP and allow your team to Level Up. 
      Every time you level up, you be rewarded with cash, fans, energy and diamonds! 
      The amount rewarded in cash, and fans will increase with each level, so 
      the higher your level, the greater your reward amount will be.</p>
	  <p class="p1"> </p>	  
    <p class="p1">There are 3 different levels of training drills that will become 
      available to your team; Rookie, Amateur, and Pro. When you first start with 
      your team, only the Rookie level of drills are available. As your team gains 
      more levels, the Amateur and Pro level of drills will also become available. 
    </p>
	<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">In all three levels, there are a number of drills that you can 
      use your energy on. The drills will become progressively more efficient; 
      meaning that you will gain more XP for less energy. The better drills will 
      open up to your club as you master the previous drills, and if you team 
      has played the required number of friendly matches.</p>

    <p class="p1">It's time to decide which method of training the squad will focus 
      on during the coming week. The players train together, so everyone will 
      learn the same thing. One idea is to look for weak spots in your team, and 
      try to improve them through training. You could also focus on your best 
      young players and choose a training type that will make them even better, 
      and build your future around them.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Every week you get to choose what kind of training you want 
      your players to concentrate on in training sessions. The effects of the 
      weekly training always appear on the beginning of the next following week. 
      The training type selected when the update starts is the one that will be 
      trained that week. You make your training selection in the Coach section.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Younger players are in general faster learners than older players, 
      but how much your player will learn from training also depends on the skill 
      levels he's at - the lower the skill level the faster the training. Training 
      on very low skill levels is many times faster than on medium skill levels, 
      and training on very high skill levels is slower than on medium skill levels.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">If you have a good coach, training will be more effective than 
      if you have a bad one. Assistant coaches also increase the effect of training.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">When a player gets closer to the age of 30, he loses a little 
      of his skills each week. How big the decrease is depends on how old the 
      player is and the level of skill he is at. The higher level of skill the 
      player is at, the bigger decrease. Older players also suffer from bigger 
      decreases than younger ones.</p>
    <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Players at the higher skill levels may experience decreases 
      even when they are younger, making further training on that particular skill 
      less appealing. Note that the higher the skill, the faster the decrease</p>

      your club. There are a wide variety of staff members available. You should 
      hire as many staff as you can afford, but a good start could be at least 
      one assistant coach.</p>

<p class="p1">Both sponsor and fans control important sources of income. Therefore it is strongly advised to have a good relation with them and keep their mood up - it will pay off in the end.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">The members of your fan club decide a lot when it comes to your team's finances. Fan amount decides a lot when it comes to your income from stadium ticket sales.</p>
<p class="p1">The easiest way to keep their mood up, and attract more fans, is to exceed their expectations. Fan increases every time you win a match. Fan decreases a bit when you loose a match.</p>
<p class="p1"><b> </b></p>
<p class="p1">As your team advances or drops in the league system, your fans will slowly get used to the new situation. If you just got promoted, fans will not expect much from you. But if you are staying put in the same division year after year, fans will have a tendency to hope for just a little more.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">Sponsors prefer supporting a club sporting a good &quot;image&quot; to which they can be connected. The more successful your team is and the bigger your team's fan club is, the better image and the more sponsor money you'll get. Spokespersons help to improve the club's image.</p>

      Each weekend the finances are updated and a new report is created. Keep 
      an eye on your reports and make sure not to get in too much debt or the 
      team could go bankrupt.</p>

    <p class="p1">Alliances give your team another opportunity to compete in 
      big tournaments, and to gain experience, revenue, and possibly fame. Each 
      Alliance has its own tournament that is open to the member teams of that 
      Alliance. The Alliance tournaments are run similar to the Cup tournament 
      in that it is single elimination and will run over a number of rounds depending 
      on how many teams are in the Alliance. All member teams of an Alliance 
      are automatically entered into the Alliance tournaments, and a new tournament 
      should start a week or two after the previous one has finished.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Each Alliance can have a different feel. Some Alliances will 
      be large with a 100 or more teams and large prizes, and others maybe very 
      small with only 20 teams and a smaller prize. Some Alliances can be joined 
      by any team, and other Alliances may have stricter requirements for joining 
      (for example: teams need to be above or below a certain level or have a 
      stadium of a certain level). The characteristics of the Alliance can 
      be determined by the President of the Alliance, and hopefully listed 
      on the Alliance information page. </p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
<p class="p1">Once your team has joined an Alliance, you can make it better by donating 
      money that can be used for the tournament prizes or donating diamonds to 
      help the Alliance climb to higher levels.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">If have some extra cash, you may even want to create your own 
      new Alliance. As president of the new Alliance you would have the 
      freedom to determine what would be the characteristics of your Alliance. 
      To help shape your new Alliance you could set out the requirements for 
      joining the Alliance on the Alliance information page, and you will 
      also have the power to accept or reject the applicant teams.</p>
<p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Once again, joining an Alliance is a great way to get more 
      games, experience for your players, revenue, and possibly a trophy or two.</p>

    <p class="p1">There are many actions or accomplishments in the game that once 
      you complete them will qualify you for an Achievement. Once you have earned 
      an Achievement you can look in the Achievements section and you will see 
      a claim button for the Achievement. When you click on the claim button, 
      you will be given a cash reward, and will have a record of accomplishing 
      the Achievement.</p>
	  <p class="p1"> </p>
    <p class="p1">Using the Achievements is a great way to get your team started 
      with the rewards that you get back from the Achievements. This way you can 
      try out various actions of managing your team, and be rewarded. For example, 
      when you hire a staff member, most of the positions will have an Achievement 
      that will return some or all of the cost for hiring the staff member. So 
      make sure you are looking at the many Achievements that are available to 
      you as a manager.</p>

      They host their own cups with prizes up into the millions! </p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1">The possibilities are endless in this game, and there are many 
      strategies you can play and try what is best for you. You can discuss strategy 
      with other players through the chat. If you do enjoy the game and would 
      like to progress faster, then just spend a bit on energy refills or any 
      other in-app purchases you like.</p>
